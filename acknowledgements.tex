\noindent
Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My advisor, Dr. Ventura, and all the other faculty and staff members here at Cal Poly I am fortunate to interact with, faculty and staff at Fresno State, Sathyabama University, and all the other schools I am an alumnus of, my family, and my friends for going above and beyond in helping me set sail in and even course through uncharted potential with oft-increasing frequency. It's as they say: you tend to a sapling until it takes firm root and starts bearing fruit. I feel all these people have been doing all that and more all along, and I can't wait to give back in ways that far surpass my imagination.
    \item Richard Tucker, for his selfless and infectious enthusiasm in guiding our project.
    \item Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008) saying, ``Jarvis, sometimes you gotta run before you can walk," before pushing the limits of the Mark II armor.
    \item A Panda Express fortune cookie fortune for prophesizing ``Love first --- then everything will follow."
    \item Andrew Guenther, for uploading this template.
