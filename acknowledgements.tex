Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My advisor, Dr Ventura, and all the other faculty and staff members here at Cal Poly I was fortunate to work with, faculty and staff at Fresno State and all the other schools I am an alumnus of, my family, and my friends for and all their guidance, love, support, and hard work in helping make my dreams a reality. It's as they say: you tend to a sapling regularly until it takes firm root and starts bearing fruit; and I feel all these people have been doing all that and more all along, and I can't wait to give back in ways that far surpass my imagination.
    \item Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008) saying, ``Jarvis, sometimes you gotta run before you can walk", before pushing the limits of the Mark II armor.
    \item Andrew Guenther, for uploading this template
