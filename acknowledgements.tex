Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My advisor, Dr Ventura, and all the other faculty and staff members here at Cal Poly I was fortunate enough to interact with, faculty and staff at Fresno State and all the other universities and schools I am an alumnus of, my family, and friends for and all their love, guidance, support, and hard work in helping make my dreams a reality. It's as they say, you take care of a sapling by tending to it regularly until the day it takes firm root and starts giving back, and I feel all these people have been doing exactly that all along, and I can't wait to "bear fruit" and give back in ways that far surpass my imagination.
