... my family, and my friends for all their guidance, love, support, and for going above and beyond in helping make my dreams a reality. It's as they say: you tend to a sapling regularly until it takes firm root and starts bearing fruit; ... Because, when God/Nature is investing in you so much via all these channels, you'd best expect surprises not just for yourself but for God knows how many beings and in how many mysterious ways.

The show Ted Lasso, for helping bring back a touch of humanity/sanity in these turbulent times.

dhamma.org for helping me understand that there could indeed be something more than meets the eye and appreciate the possibility of the limitlessness of reality.

Echkart Tolle for introducing me to Presence.

And for my advisor and committee members for believing in me and giving me what I need despite me doing all the crazy things in the world.
