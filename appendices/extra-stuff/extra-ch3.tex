maybe talk to them about the origins of mannequin challenge at jacksonville highschool and scientist say that ease of access is also probably why it became famous - 2016
this was actually mannequin challenge version 1 hope the get to extend their dataset just like how real estate was able to be extended

% Visual SLAM and structure-from-motion have no way of determining absolute scale without external information:
% each of our training sequences is therefore equally valid
% if we scale the world (including the sparse point sets and
% the translation part of the camera poses) up or down by
% any constant factor. This is not an issue when dealing with
% multiple-image input since the relative pose between the
% inputs resolves the scale ambiguity, but it poses a challenge for learning any sort of 3D representation from a single input.

% 4.3 Refining poses with bundle adjustment
% We next process each sequence at higher resolution, using a standard
% structure-from-motion pipeline to extract features from each
% frame, match these features across frames, and perform a global
% bundle adjustment using the Ceres non-linear least squares optimizer
% [Agarwal et al. 2016].

must mention how we dealt with the imbalance in our datasets for the extended dataset re10k+mc

we made a FORAY in multi worker systems not a gem of an achievement but a FORAY
