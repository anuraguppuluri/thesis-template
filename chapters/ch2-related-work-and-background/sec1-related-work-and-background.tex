\chapter{Related Work and Background}\label{ch2:related-work-background}

In this thesis, we have not created novel models or datasets but have curated preexisting datasets and retrained a state-of-the-art CNN. Data curation has been an essential part of our work as the datasets' YouTube videos are subject to modifications over time. These modifications are in terms of the videos being taken down from YouTube or the required 1280x720 pixel (720p) versions of them becoming unavailable, etc. The curation process included action items like downloading and using only 720p resolution videos across the board so as to minimize the chances of running into training errors, etc., as explained in section~\ref{sec2:data}. As for simulating the 3D video chat experience itself, we linked up the API of OpenFace 2.2 --- a preexisting head pose estimation model --- to the MPI inference procedure so the MPI inference may generate novel views rendered in the head pose evaluated by OpenFace 2.2, as explained in section~\ref{sec3:implementation}

This chapter explores related work in two areas: MPIs and 3D video chat, while providing clarifications on background concepts along the way. The research papers of particular interest to us as far as the MPI component of our work is concerned are 2018's Zhou et al.~\cite{zhou2018stereo} and 2020's Tucker and Snavely~\cite{single_view_mpi}. This is because we have attempted to adapt and apply Tucker and Snavely's work to the purposes of video chatting and their work draws directly from Zhou et al. We have also sought to differentiate 2016's~\cite{deep_stereo_2016} and~\cite{kalantari_2016} from Zhou et al. as it, in turn, is heavily inspired by them and as they would be integral to understanding the motivations of Zhou et al. As for progress in the field of 3D video chat, we have mentioned the yet to be released state-of-the-art 3D video chat system: Google's Project Starline.
