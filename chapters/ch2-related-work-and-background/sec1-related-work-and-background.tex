\chapter{Related Work and Background}\label{ch2:related-work-background}

In this thesis, we have not created novel models or datasets but have rather curated preexisting datasets and retrained a state-of-the-art CNN. Data curation has been an essential part of our work as the datasets' YouTube videos are subject to modifications over time. These modifications are in terms of the videos being taken down from YouTube or the required 1280$\times$720 pixel (720p) resolution versions of them becoming unavailable, etc. The curation process included action items like downloading and training only on 720p versions of the datasets' videos so as to minimize the chances of running into training errors, etc., as explained in section~\ref{sec:data}. As for simulating the 3D video chat experience itself, we linked-up the API of OpenFace 2.2~\cite{baltrusaitis_openface_2018} --- a preexisting head pose estimation model --- to the MPI inference procedure so the MPI inference may generate novel views rendered at the head pose evaluated by OpenFace 2.2, as explained in section~\ref{sec:implementation}.

This chapter explores related work in two areas: MPIs and 3D video chat, while providing clarifications on background concepts along the way. The research papers of particular interest to us as far as the MPI component of our work is concerned are 2018's Zhou et al.~\cite{zhou2018stereo} and 2020's Tucker and Snavely~\cite{single_view_mpi}, which we consider to be our base papers. This is because we have attempted to adapt and apply Tucker and Snavely's work to the purposes of video chatting and their work directly draws from Zhou et al. We have also sought to differentiate 2016's DeepStereo~\cite{deep_stereo_2016} and Kalantari et al.~\cite{kalantari_2016} from Zhou et al. as it, in turn, is inspired by them and surpasses them performance-wise. As for progress in the field of 3D video chat, we have mentioned the state-of-the-art 3D video chat system: Google's Project Starline; among other projects.
