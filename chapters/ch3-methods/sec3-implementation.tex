\section{Implementation}\label{sec3:implementation} 

Training details. We implement our system in TensorFlow [Abadi
et al. 2016]. We train the network using the ADAM solver [Kingma
and Ba 2014] for 600K iterations with learning rate 0.0002, β1 =
0.9, β2 = 0.999, and batch size 1. During training, the images and
MPI have a spatial resolution of 1024 × 576, but the model can be
applied to arbitrary resolution at test time in a fully-convolutional
manner. Training takes about one week on a Tesla P100 GPU.

They didn't even use multiGPU

issue happened is the resolution had to be fixed and colmap had to be run again

difference between train.py throws NaN gradient errors np.loadtext thingie and np.generatefromtext thingie such that one possibly inclused empty and the other discards copletely?

training just takes +1 frame to be the target
only testing takes +5 or +10 frames according to the 2020 paper


Expanding upon pipeline description ---

video ------------> input 1 --------------> training
|

|-----------------> COLMAP -----------> 3D points per video frame -------------> input 2 -----------> same training

how does data loader work?

Original authors choice with colmap 
my reason for pursuing colmap
what does colmap do> --------> bundle adjustment, triangulation, 

COLMAP highlevel
