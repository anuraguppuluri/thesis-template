from deep stereo paper the causes for overfitting

Deep networks have enjoyed huge success in recent
years, particularly for image understanding tasks [20, 29].
Despite these successes, relatively little work exists on applying
deep learning to computer graphics problems and especially
to generating new views from real imagery. One
possible reason is the perceived inability of deep networks
to generate pixels directly, but recent work on denoising
[35], super-resolution [6], and rendering [21] suggest
that this is a misconception. Another common objection is
that deep networks have a huge number of parameters and
hence are prone to overfitting in the absence of enormous
quantities of data, but recent work [29] has demonstrated
state-of-the-art deep networks whose parameters number in
the low millions, greatly reducing the potential for overfitting.

from deep stereo on the success of neural nets

In this work we present a new approach to new view synthesis
that uses deep networks to regress directly to output
pixel colors given the posed input images. Our system
is able to interpolate between views separated by a
wide baseline and exhibits resilience to traditional failure
modes, including graceful degradation in the presence of
scene motion and specularities. We posit this is due to the
end-to-end nature of the training, and the ability of deep
networks to learn extremely complex non-linear functions
of their inputs [25].
Additionally, although we focus on its application
to new view problems here, we believe that the
deep architecture presented can be readily applied to other
stereo and graphics problems given suitable training data.
Because
of the variety of the scenes seen in training our system is robust
and generalizes to indoor and outdoor imagery, as well
as to image collections used in prior work.
