\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We assembled 2020â€™s state-of-the-art single-view view synthesis pipeline. We applied Multiplane Images, which are essentially mini-local-light-field representations, to the field of 3D video chat because they are one of the first representations capable of real-time, high-quality, spatially-consistent view synthesis. We completed implementing both ways of a potentially real-time, rendering pipeline that takes in the head pose of each ``viewer" video frame and rerenders the corresponding ``viewee" video frame --- the one that syncs with the timestamp of the ``viewer".
