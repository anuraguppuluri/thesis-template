\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

As hypothesized, the PSNR and SSIM metrics of the baseline model compared to the retrained model show that there is a slight improvement in the performance of a model trained exclusive on the non-video-chat-relevant real estate data to the much-more-video-chat relevant Mannequin Challenge data 

The qualities of the rendered image and the predicted MPI have been improved first by going from training exclusively on real estate data to going to exclusive training on mannequin data and then finally onto a mix of both. We complete the one-way part of a two-way potentially real-time rendering pipeline that takes in the head pose of each source video frame and renders the corresponding target video frame i.e., the one that syncs with the timestamp of the source in this head pose.

We used MPI to solve 3D video chat problem because of it real-time view and other view synthesis properties mentioned in the base paper section. high quality, spatially - consistent and high-resolution sythesis and rendering 
in defence mention that mpi essentially constructs a mini lighht field
